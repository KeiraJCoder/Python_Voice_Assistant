Speech Recognition and Response Project
This project utilizes speech recognition to transcribe audio input from the user, generates a response using OpenAI's GPT model, and reads the response back to the user using text-to-speech.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Windows 10 or later
Python 3.8 or newer installed
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project environment on Windows:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
cd [local-repository]
Replace [repository-url] with the URL of the project's repository and [local-repository] with the name of the folder where you cloned the project.

2. Create a Virtual Environment
Open a command prompt in the project directory and run:

Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

Copy code
pip install openai pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition PyAudio
Installing PyAudio
If you encounter any issues installing PyAudio with pip, you may need to install a precompiled PyAudio wheel for Windows. Download the appropriate .whl file from Christoph Gohlke's Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages and install it using:

bash
Copy code
pip install path/to/PyAudio-*.whl
Replace path/to/PyAudio-*.whl with the actual path to the downloaded .whl file.

4. Set Up OpenAI API Key
Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
Set the API key as an environment variable on your system:
For a temporary setup, in your command prompt, run:

arduino
Copy code
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
For a permanent setup, search for "Environment Variables" in Windows search and add OPENAI_API_KEY as a new system variable.

Replace your_api_key_here with your actual OpenAI API key.

Running the Program
With the virtual environment activated and the OpenAI API key set, you can run the program by executing:

css
Copy code
python main.py
Ensure your microphone is properly configured and say "Hey Frankie" to activate the recording, followed by your question or command.

Troubleshooting
PyAudio Installation Issues: Ensure you have the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools installed. If PyAudio still fails to install, use the precompiled .whl method as described above.
Microphone Not Recognized: Check your system's sound settings to ensure your microphone is set as the default recording device.
